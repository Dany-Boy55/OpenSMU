# Mainboard KiCAD design files

Here is a verbatim copy of Dave Erickson's original design for the SMU mainboard. Translated into kicad from diptrace by re-drawing the schematic. 
I used as many built in KiCAD symbols as possible to avoid drawing custom ones. This however means that many components are using pin compatible parts.
These components will be 
 - OPA2140 is OPA2197 in the kicad version
 - ADR431 is ADR421 in kicad
 - All solid state relays are CPC1017 in kicad
 - BAV199 are BAV99
